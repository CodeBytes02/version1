			<br><p><b>About author : </b>Satchidananda Dehuri, TARE Fellow is working 
				as a Professor in the Department of Computer Science. 
				Faldir Mohan University, Balasore, Odisha, India since 2013.
				 He received his M.Tech and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science</p>

			<p>Machine learning (ML) (1 and data science (DS) are two important dominating
				 fields in recent days in the area of computer science and 
				 information technology. They are increasingly used as effective and 
				 efficient tools for solving all most all problems occurring in every 
				 sphere of life. The dramatic growth of algorithmic decision making under 
				 the umbrella of machine learning and decision science continues to gain 
				 momentum in marketing, research in this stream is still inadequate 
				 despite the devastating asymmetric and oppressive impacts of 
				 lgorithmic bias on various customer groups There are advantages to 
				 algorithmic decision-making: unlike human, ML and DS agents does not
				become tired However, like human, ML and DS agents are vulnerable to
				discrimination that renders its decisions "unfair. Discrimination is
				the unfair treatment of individuals based on specific characteristics,
				also called sensitive features such as gender and race. It has been
				found that machine learning not only leads to unexpected results
				with bias, but also has amplified algorithmic bias. Extensive 
				studies have been conducted to achieve the fairness in ML and
				DS model, and generally categorized in three approaches: preprocessing 
				in processing and post-processing Pre-processing solves the problem by 
				eliminating the bias present in the training data itself. In-processing 
				reduces the bias by adding a constraint to the learning algorithm even
				if there is a bias in the data Postprocessing ensues decisions themselves.
				Readers may refer [2] for more details on algorithmic bias 
				Now we will turn our attention to second part of our topic of discussion 
				le, multilabel classification</p>

			<p>Landing the job you want isn't always a straightforward process.
			Everything from spellbinding your resume to exhilarating your 
			interviewers can be challenging and completely nerve-racking 
			Top companies not only look for people who work hard but people
			with a positive attitude Always come up with a great story that 
			speaks to your dedication, hard work and perseverance And you've 
			heard it before, because it's true 'Communication is key". always
			try to be proactive and express your interest, this mantra will 
			definitely place you in great hands.</p><br>
			<p>
				Being a fresher, you need to get your foot in the door. A generic
			    resume isn't likely going to do it, no matter how polished it looks.
			    So make sure it lines up with the job description because any 
				communication to the hiring mariagers should be very clear in a 
				way you're a fit for the role.
